## Introduction
The project offers two classic games: Tic-tac-toe and the Dino Game. Developed using C programming language, these games provide interactive entertainment and problem-solving challenges. This project aims to highlight the simplicity and versatility of C in game development.

## Design and Implementation
### Code
The code consists of three main parts: the main function, the Dino Game, and the Tic-tac-toe game. It utilizes standard C libraries and functions for game logic and user interaction.

### Code Output
- User can select between the Dino Game and Tic-tac-toe.
- **Dino Game**:
  - Dino jumps on space bar press and terminates upon obstacle collision.
- **Tic-tac-toe**:
  - Allows two players to play, declares winner or draw accordingly.

## Conclusion and Future Enhancement
This project demonstrates the capabilities of C programming in game development. Future enhancements may include adding AI to Tic-tac-toe, improving user interface, and introducing different difficulty levels in the Dino Game.
